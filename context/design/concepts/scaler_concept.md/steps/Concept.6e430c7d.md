# Concept: ScalingTips

**Purpose**: Manages and stores context-specific tips for scaling different cooking methods. üßë‚Äçüç≥ \
**Principle**: Given a cooking method, this concept generates tips on how to properly scale a recipe up or down. Tips can be added manually as a fallback or generated by an LLM for more nuanced advice.

### Core State

* **tipsDatabase**: A map where keys are cooking methods (e.g., "Baking", "Frying") and values are a set of associated tips. Each tip record contains:
  * **tip**: string
  * **direction**: string ("up" or "down")
  * **recipeContext**: string (optional name of the associated recipe)

### Core Actions

* `addManualTip(cookingMethod: string, direction: string, tip: string, recipe: string): void` - Manually adds a new scaling tip to the database.
  * **Requires**: The `cookingMethod` must be valid for the given `recipe`, and `direction` must be either "up" or "down".
  * **Effect**: A new tip record is created and stored.
* `addAITip(cookingMethod: string, direction: string, recipe: string): string` - Uses an LLM to generate and store a new scaling tip.
  * **Requires**: The `cookingMethod` must be valid for the given `recipe`, and `direction` must be either "up" or "down".
  * **Effect**: Prompts an LLM for a relevant tip, stores it in the database, and returns the generated tip string.
* `removeTip(cookingMethod: string): void` - Removes all tips associated with a specific cooking method.
  * **Requires**: The `cookingMethod` must exist as a key in the tips database.
  * **Effect**: Removes the cooking method and all of its associated tips from the database.
* `getTip(cookingMethod: string, direction: string, recipe: string): string` - Retrieves a specific tip from the database.
  * **Requires**: A tip matching the `cookingMethod`, `direction`, and `recipe` must exist in the database.
  * **Effect**: Returns the matching tip string.
