concept Scaler

purpose
    meant to store recipe and scale to the input factor

principle recipe either manually inputted or uploaded along with scale factor
	    on scale, ingredient counts are scaled by the given factor
	    scale factor and entire recipe context taken into account through LLM when scaling

state
    a set of recipes
        a name
        a scale factor
        a set of ingredients
        a set of cookingMethods

actions
    enterRecipe (name: String, originalPeople: Number, targetPeople: number, ingredients: List[Ingredient], cookingMethods: List[String]): ()
        requires targetPeople to be a whole number between [1, 50] and name to be unique
        effect creates a scale factor based on the original number of people and the target amount and enters this recipe into the set of recipes. Optional cooking methods can be added to be associated with the recipe.

    removeRecipe(name: String): ()
        requires name to be in set of recipes
        effect removes recipe from scaler

    scaleManually (name: String): (result: List[Ingredient])
        requires name to be in set of recipes
        effect returns the list of ingredients after each being scaled linearly according to the scale factor
        
    scaleRecipeAI (name: String): (result: List[Ingredient])
        requires name to be in set of recipes
        effect inputs the entire recipe in an LLM to use as context when deciding how much to scale each ingredient
