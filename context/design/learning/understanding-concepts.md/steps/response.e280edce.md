# response:

This `NotCapable: Requires env access to "MONGODB_URL"` error, even with `-A`, is a tricky one, and it means the environment variable `MONGODB_URL` isn't available *at the precise moment* Deno (or a dependency) tries to read it, despite the broad permissions.

The most robust solution, mirroring how `RecipeConcept.test.ts` likely works by relying on `testDb()` to handle initial setup, is to ensure `dotenv.config()` is called **at the very beginning of each `Deno.test` block** where environment variables are needed. This makes sure that `MONGODB_URL` (and `GEMINI_API_KEY` if you use it in `.env`) are loaded into the Deno process's environment for that specific test's runtime.

Additionally, to address your request of loading `GEMINI_API_KEY` from a `config.json` file, we'll modify the `getLLMClient()` helper to prioritize reading from `config.json` and fall back to environment variables if the file is missing or the key isn't found. This requires `--allow-read` permission.

***

### Step 1: Create `config.json`

Create a file named `config.json` in your project's **root directory** with your Gemini API key:

```json
// config.json
{
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

(Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.)

### Step 2: Update `deno.json`

Ensure `deno.json` includes `read` permission for your `test` task or at the top level, and has the `dotenv` import alias:

```json
// deno.json
{
  "imports": {
    "google-generative-ai": "npm:@google/generative-ai@^0.12.0",
    "mongodb": "npm:mongodb@^6.5.0",
    "dotenv": "https://deno.land/x/dotenv@v3.2.2/mod.ts", // Make sure this is present
    "@std/assert": "jsr:@std/assert@^0.218.0",
    "@utils/": "./utils/"
  },
  "tasks": {
    "test": "deno test --allow-env --allow-net --allow-sys --allow-read" // Ensure --allow-read is here
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update `src/recipescaler/RecipeScalerConcept.test.ts`

Here's the refactored test file. Key changes:

1. **`import { config } from "dotenv";`**: Added to allow calling `config()`.
2. **`config({ export: true, allowEmptyValues: true });`**: This line is now explicitly added at the *very beginning* of each `Deno.test` block that needs environment variables. This is the most reliable way to ensure `dotenv` loads your `.env` file for that specific test run.
3. **`getLLMClient()` is now `async`**: Because it uses `Deno.readTextFile()`.
4. **`getLLMClient()` logic**: Prioritizes `config.json` for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, then falls back to environment variables.
5. **`await getLLMClient()`**: All calls to `getLLMClient()` are now `await`ed.
6. **`permissions`**: Updated `permissions` in `Deno.test` blocks to include `read: true` where `config.json` is accessed, and `env: true` for the environment variable fallback.
