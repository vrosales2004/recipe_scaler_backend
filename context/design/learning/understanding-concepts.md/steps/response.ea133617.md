# response:

You're getting that `NotCapable: Requires env access to "MONGODB_URL"` error, even with the `-A` flag, because of a very specific interaction between Deno's permission model and how modules are loaded, especially `dotenv`.

The problem isn't in your `database.ts` file itself, nor is it typically a typo in `MONGODB_URL`. The `import "jsr:@std/dotenv/load";` line is the correct way to automatically load `.env` variables in Deno.

The issue is that **your `Deno.test` blocks with `permissions: { ... }` are overriding the global permissions *too early* for the `dotenv` module to load environment variables.**

Here's the sequence of events that's likely causing the error:

1. You run `deno test --allow-all src/scalingtips/ScalingTipsConcept.test.ts`. The main Deno process has all permissions.
2. Deno starts parsing `src/scalingtips/ScalingTipsConcept.test.ts`.
3. `src/scalingtips/ScalingTipsConcept.test.ts` imports `testDb` from `@utils/database.ts`.
4. When `database.ts` is loaded, its top-level `import "jsr:@std/dotenv/load";` executes. This line tries to load your `.env` file, which requires `env` permission.
5. **Critically:** If the *first* `Deno.test` block in `src/scalingtips/ScalingTipsConcept.test.ts` (or any of the imports leading to `database.ts`) has a `permissions` object that *doesn't* include `env: true`, then Deno effectively "pledges" (restricts) the permissions for that module's execution context. Even though the main process has `--allow-all`, that specific module context doesn't.
6. `dotenv` then fails to load the environment variables because its execution context is missing the necessary `env` permission, leading to the `NotCapable` error.

### The Solution: Remove `permissions` objects from all `Deno.test` blocks in the test file.

By removing the `permissions: { ... }` object from your `Deno.test` calls, you tell Deno: "This test block should simply **inherit all permissions granted to the main `deno test` command**."

This ensures that the `database.ts` module, when loaded, will always run in a context that has all the permissions granted on the command line (like `--allow-env`, `--allow-net`, etc.).

Let's refactor `src/scalingtips/ScalingTipsConcept.test.ts` to remove all explicit `permissions` objects.
