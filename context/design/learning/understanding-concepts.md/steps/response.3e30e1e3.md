# response:

You're absolutely right! The best way to simplify and fix this issue is to align the `RecipeScalerConcept.test.ts` environment variable loading with what's already working perfectly in `RecipeConcept.test.ts`.

The core problem, even with `-A` or `--allow-env`, is usually one of two things:

1. **Timing of `dotenv.config()`:** If `dotenv.config()` isn't called *before* the first `Deno.env.get("MONGODB_URL")` call happens, then the variable won't be in the environment when it's accessed, leading to this error.
2. **Redundant `dotenv.config()` calls:** Sometimes calling `dotenv.config()` multiple times or in different contexts can interact poorly with Deno's permissions or how it internalizes environment variables.

Your `RecipeConcept.test.ts` implicitly handles this by relying on `testDb()` (from `@utils/database.ts`) to manage the `dotenv.config()` call. The `getLLMClient()` helper in `RecipeScalerConcept.test.ts` was duplicating this `config()` call, which is likely the source of the conflict.

### The Solution:

We will modify `getLLMClient()` to **remove the redundant `config()` call**. It will now *assume* that `dotenv.config()` has already been handled by `testDb()` (or a global `Deno.test.beforeAll` setup in `@utils/database.ts`). This is the cleanest and most Deno-native way to do it.

**Crucial assumption:** I will assume that the `Deno.env.get()` call in your `utils/database.ts` is indeed looking for `"MONGODB_URL"` as per the error message. If your `.env` file actually uses `MONGODB_URI`, you'll need to adjust either your `.env` file or the `Deno.env.get()` call in `utils/database.ts`.

Here's the updated `src/recipescaler/RecipeScalerConcept.test.ts` file:
