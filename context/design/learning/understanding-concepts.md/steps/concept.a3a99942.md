# concept: UserAuthentication

* **concept**: UserAuthentication \[User]
* **purpose**: To provide secure mechanisms for users to register, log in, and log out of the application, establishing their identity.
* **principle**: A user registers with a unique username and password. The user subsequently logs in with those credentials, and they will be recognized as an authenticated user, which enables them to access personalized features.
* **state**:
  * A set of `Users` with
    * a `username` of type `String`
    * a `hashedPassword` of type `String`
  * A set of `Sessions` with
    * a `user` of type `User`
    * a `sessionId` of type `String`
    * an `expirationTime` of type `Number` (Unix timestamp)
* **actions**:
  * `register (username: String, password: String): (user: User) | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `username` must be unique. `password` must meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length).
    * **effects**: Creates a new `User` record with the given details (username and hashed password). Returns the new `User` ID.
  * `login (username: String, password: String): (user: User, sessionId: String) | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `username` and `password` must match an existing user.
    * **effects**: If credentials are valid, creates a new `Session` for the `User` with a unique `sessionId` and a calculated `expirationTime`. Returns the `User` ID and the `sessionId`.
  * `logout (sessionId: String): () | (error: String)`
    * **requires**: `sessionId` must correspond to an active session.
    * **effects**: Deletes the `Session` record, invalidating it. Returns an empty object on success.
