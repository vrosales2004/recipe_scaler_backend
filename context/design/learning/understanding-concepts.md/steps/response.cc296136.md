# response:

Okay, I understand completely. You want to temporarily disable or remove the parts of the tests that rely on the external LLM calls to focus on the core functionality, while maintaining the structure of your previous test files.

This means we'll:

1. **Create a very basic `DummyLLMClient`:** This client will implement the `ILLMClient` interface but will not make any actual API calls. Its `executeLLM` method will either throw an error (simulating failure) or return a predefined, minimal response, to satisfy type checks during instantiation.
2. **Pass this `DummyLLMClient` to `RecipeScalerConcept`:** In all tests, this dummy client will fulfill the constructor's `llmClient: ILLMClient` requirement.
3. **Remove all LLM-specific tests:** Any `Deno.test` block or assertions that specifically rely on the intelligent, non-linear scaling behavior of the LLM or the LLM's tip generation will be removed.

Here's the updated `src/recipescaler/RecipeScalerConcept.test.ts` file.
