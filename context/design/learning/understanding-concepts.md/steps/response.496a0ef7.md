# response:

Here's the test file for your `RecipeScalerConcept`, designed to match the structure of your `LikertSurvey` and `Recipe` tests. It includes specific scenarios to check for non-linear scaling behavior from the AI model, as requested.

This test file assumes:

* `@utils/database.ts` provides `testDb()` (which clears the database for each `Deno.test` block).
* `@utils/types.ts` provides the `ID` type.
* Your MongoDB instance is accessible.
* The `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is set for the `GeminiLLM` to function correctly. If you don't have this set up or want to avoid real API calls during tests, you would typically inject a `MockLLMClient` (similar to what we've used before) into the `RecipeScalerConcept`'s constructor *during testing only*. For this implementation, I'm assuming `GeminiLLM` is used as requested.
