Okay, I understand. You want to simplify the `ScalingTipsConcept.test.ts` file to precisely mimic the working `RecipeConcept.test.ts` structure, which means **removing all explicit `dotenv.config()` calls** from within the `Deno.test` blocks. This implies that your `testDb()` function (from `@utils/database.ts`) or some global setup in your `utils` directory is responsible for loading environment variables like `MONGODB_URL`.

We'll also ensure the `getLLMClient()` helper strictly returns the `DummyLLMClient`, completely isolating the tests from any real LLM interaction.

Here's the refactored `src/scalingtips/ScalingTipsConcept.test.ts` file:
