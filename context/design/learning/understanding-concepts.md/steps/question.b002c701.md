# question: is it fine that im getting the following warning from the first import line: Inline 'npm:', 'jsr:' or 'https:' dependency not allowed  Add it as a dependency in a deno.json or package.json instead and reference it here via its bare specifierdeno-lint(no-import-prefix) Missing version in specifier  Add a version requirement after the package namedeno-lint(no-unversioned-import)
