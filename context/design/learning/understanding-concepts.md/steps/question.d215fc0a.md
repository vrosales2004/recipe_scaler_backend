# question: okay! can you also make a test file for Scaler? exactly the same way as before mimicing the structure of the example. to test for scaling up/down just make some ingredients with a scaling context that is very clear to "scale less than linearly" or the opposite. with these ingredients we should check if they scaled strictly more than linearly.
