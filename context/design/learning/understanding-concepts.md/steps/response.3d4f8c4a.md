Here's the implementation for your `UserAuthentication` concept, following the Concept Design principles and using MongoDB for state persistence.

I've included a simple password hashing mechanism using Deno's `crypto.subtle`. In a production application, you would typically use a dedicated, more robust password hashing library like `bcrypt` (often available via npm) for better security, salt management, and protection against brute-force attacks.
