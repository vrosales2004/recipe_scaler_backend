# response:

Okay, I understand. You want the `RecipeConcept.test.ts` file to follow the exact pattern of the `LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts` example you provided, where each individual test (including setup and teardown) is self-contained within its own `Deno.test` block, without using `test.beforeAll`, `test.beforeEach`, or `test.afterAll` hooks within a test suite.

This approach means each `Deno.test` block will:

1. Call `testDb()` to get a fresh database connection and a clean database state (relying on the `@utils/database.ts`'s global `Deno.test.beforeAll` or `testDb` function's internal logic to clear the database before each `Deno.test` execution).
2. Instantiate `RecipeConcept` with that `db` instance.
3. Contain its specific test logic.
4. Use a `try...finally` block to ensure `client.close()` is called for that specific test's connection.

Here is the refactored `RecipeConcept.test.ts` file, adhering strictly to this pattern:
