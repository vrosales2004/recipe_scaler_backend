Okay, I understand. You want each `Deno.test` block in `RecipeScalerConcept.test.ts` to be fully self-contained, including the setup of the `GeminiLLM` client, mimicking the pattern where `new GeminiLLM()` was called directly within your original `scaler.scaleRecipe` test functions. This means we will instantiate `GeminiLLM` within each test that requires it, and pass that instance to the `RecipeScalerConcept`'s constructor.

This approach ensures strict test isolation: each test completely controls its own dependencies, including the LLM client, without relying on global state or `Deno.test.beforeAll` hooks for the LLM setup.

Here's the refactored test file, adhering to this self-contained, per-test instantiation pattern:
