# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `RecipeScaler` concept is fulfilled through AI-driven scaling, storing the result, and making it available for retrieval.

1. **Given**: An author `user:Alice` has already added a "Spicy Chili" recipe with its original servings and a diverse set of ingredients, some of which require non-linear scaling (e.g., "Salt" as a delicate spice, "Garlic Cloves" as a discrete item).
   * (Implicit action from `RecipeConcept.addRecipe`):
     ```
     Recipe.addRecipe({
       author: "user:Alice",
       name: "Spicy Chili",
       originalServings: 4,
       ingredients: [
         { name: "Ground Beef", quantity: 500, unit: "g", scalingContext: "protein" },
         { name: "Canned Tomatoes", quantity: 800, unit: "g", scalingContext: "standard liquid" },
         { name: "Chili Powder", quantity: 2, unit: "tbsp", scalingContext: "strong spice" },
         { name: "Garlic Cloves", quantity: 3, unit: "cloves", scalingContext: "flavor, discrete" },
         { name: "Salt", quantity: 1, unit: "tsp", scalingContext: "to taste, delicate" },
         { name: "Water", quantity: 200, unit: "ml", scalingContext: "standard liquid" },
       ],
       cookingMethods: ["Brown beef", "Simmer ingredients", "Serve hot"],
     })
     ```
   * **Result**: `baseRecipeId: "recipe:spicychili-xyz789"`

2. **Action**: A user wants to scale "Spicy Chili" from 4 to 10 servings using the AI-driven scaler.
   ```
   RecipeScaler.scaleRecipeAI({
     baseRecipeId: "recipe:spicychili-xyz789",
     targetServings: 10,
   })
   ```

3. **Intermediate Process (within `scaleRecipeAI`):**
   * The `RecipeScaler` internally fetches the full "Spicy Chili" recipe details from the `Recipe` concept using `recipeConcept._getRecipeById`.
   * It constructs a detailed prompt including the recipe's name, original servings (4), target servings (10), all ingredients (with `scalingContext`), and cooking methods.
   * It sends this prompt to the `llmClient.executeLLM()`.
   * The LLM processes the request, intelligently deciding how to scale each ingredient:
     * `Ground Beef`, `Canned Tomatoes`, `Water` (standard items): Scaled roughly linearly (10/4 = 2.5 times).
     * `Garlic Cloves` (discrete): Likely scaled up but rounded to a whole number, e.g., from 3 to 8 (3 \* 2.5 = 7.5, rounded up).
     * `Salt` (delicate, to taste): Scaled less than linearly, perhaps remaining at 1 tsp, or only slightly increased to 1.5 tsp, rather than 2.5 tsp, to avoid over-salting.
     * `Chili Powder` (strong spice): Scaled less than linearly, perhaps to 4 tbsp instead of 5 tbsp, to avoid overpowering flavor.
   * The LLM returns a JSON object containing the `scaledIngredients`.

4. **Result**: A new `ScaledRecipe` record is created (or an existing one updated) in the `RecipeScaler`'s state, containing the `baseRecipeId`, `targetServings` (10), the `scalingMethod: 'ai'`, and the intelligently `scaledIngredients` list. The ID of this new scaled recipe is returned.
   ```
   { scaledRecipeId: "scaled:chili-ai-10serv-abc" }
   ```

5. **Action**: Later, the user (or another component) wants to access this specific AI-scaled version of the "Spicy Chili" recipe.
   ```
   RecipeScaler._getScaledRecipe({ scaledRecipeId: "scaled:chili-ai-10serv-abc" })
   ```

6. **Result**: The `ScaledRecipeDoc` for 10 servings of "Spicy Chili" is returned, showing the LLM's intelligently adjusted ingredient quantities, fulfilling the principle that the scaled recipe is stored and retrievable for cooking.
   ```
   {
     _id: "scaled:chili-ai-10serv-abc",
     baseRecipeId: "recipe:spicychili-xyz789",
     targetServings: 10,
     scaledIngredients: [
       { name: "Ground Beef", quantity: 1250, unit: "g", scalingContext: "protein" }, // 500 * 2.5
       { name: "Canned Tomatoes", quantity: 2000, unit: "g", scalingContext: "standard liquid" }, // 800 * 2.5
       { name: "Chili Powder", quantity: 4, unit: "tbsp", scalingContext: "strong spice" }, // Less than linear, e.g., 2 * ~2 = 4
       { name: "Garlic Cloves", quantity: 8, unit: "cloves", scalingContext: "flavor, discrete" }, // Rounded up, e.g., ceil(3 * 2.5) = 8
       { name: "Salt", quantity: 1.5, unit: "tsp", scalingContext: "to taste, delicate" }, // Very little change, e.g., 1 * 1.5 = 1.5
       { name: "Water", quantity: 500, unit: "ml", scalingContext: "standard liquid" }, // 200 * 2.5
     ],
     scalingMethod: "ai",
     generatedAt: <Date>,
   }
   ```

This trace demonstrates the end-to-end flow from a base recipe, through intelligent AI-driven scaling that considers various ingredient contexts, to the persistence and retrieval of the derived scaled recipe, aligning with the `RecipeScaler` concept's purpose and principle.
