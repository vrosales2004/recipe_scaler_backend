# response:

You're absolutely right! Passing the LLM instance as a parameter is a much cleaner approach. It significantly improves testability (you can easily inject a mock LLM for tests) and adheres better to the "completeness of functionality" principle without tightly coupling the concept to a *specific* LLM implementation detail in its constructor.

Let's refactor this.

First, we'll ensure our `GeminiLLM` class explicitly implements an `ILLMClient` interface. This interface defines the contract that any LLM client must fulfill, allowing for easy swapping later if you decide to use a different LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
