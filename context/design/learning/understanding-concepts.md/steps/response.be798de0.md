# response:

Okay, I understand. Here's the test file for your `ScalingTipsConcept`, completely stripping out any LLM-related setup and tests, and focusing solely on the core manual tip management and retrieval functionality.

This ensures all tests will pass reliably without requiring `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `--allow-env`, `--allow-sys`, or `--allow-read`. Only `--allow-net` is needed for the MongoDB connection.
