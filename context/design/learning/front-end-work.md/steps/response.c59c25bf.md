# response:

It seems there might still be a slight misunderstanding of the terms.

The document you provided is a **definition and explanation of "Concept Design"**, a methodology for structuring software. It describes *how one would go about designing* a system with greater modularity. It **does not contain an existing API specification**, nor does it describe a specific backend application in a way that allows for "API extraction."

Therefore, there are no "steps in api-extraction-from-spec" to complete *from the document you provided*, because that document *is not* an API spec or a source for extraction.

My previous response aimed to clarify this and then outlined what **information *you* would need to provide (about *your actual application's design*)** in order for me to help you **construct an API specification *following the Concept Design principles***.

To reiterate, to help you *design and structure* an API spec based on the Concept Design methodology, I need information that *you* would derive by applying those principles to *your specific application*.

Here's the information I would need from **you**, describing **your application's functionality** through the lens of **Concept Design**:

1. **List of Your Application's Core Concepts:**
   * What are the fundamental, reusable, user-facing units of functionality in your application? (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`, `Upvote`, `ShoppingCart`, `UserAuthentication`, `Notification`, `ProductCatalog`, etc.)
   * For each concept, briefly state its "well-defined and intelligible purpose."

2. **For Each Concept, Describe its State:**
   * What entities and relationships does this concept manage?
   * What specific properties or fields does it associate with these entities *for its own behavior*?
   * (Remember the principle: "sufficiently rich to support the conceptâ€™s behavior; ...no richer than it need be.")
   * **Example:** For an `Order` concept, its state might include `items` (with quantity and price), `customer` (identity), `status` (pending, shipped, delivered), `total_amount`. It wouldn't include the customer's full profile details if they're not relevant to the order's behavior.

3. **For Each Concept, List its Atomic Actions (API Endpoints):**
   * What are the user-facing or internal operations that this concept can perform or respond to? These will become your API endpoints.
   * For each action:
     * **Name:** (e.g., `create`, `updateStatus`, `delete`, `reserve`, `vote`).
     * **Input Arguments:** What parameters does the action require? (e.g., `itemId`, `userId`, `newStatus`, `reservationDetails`).
     * **Side Effects/Output:** What changes does this action make to the concept's state, or what information does it return?
   * **Example:** For `ShoppingCart` concept, actions might be:
     * `addItem(userId, itemId, quantity)`
     * `removeItem(userId, itemId)`
     * `updateItemQuantity(userId, itemId, newQuantity)`
     * `checkout(userId)`

4. **Key Synchronizations (How Concepts Interact):**
   * How do actions in one concept trigger actions in another? (These describe the overall application logic that ties the independent concepts together.)
   * Provide examples of your syncs using the `when ... where ... then ...` structure.
   * **Example:** "When a `ShoppingCart.checkout` action occurs for a `userId`, then `Order.create` action occurs for that `userId` with the cart's items." Or, "When `Order.status` changes to 'shipped', then `Notification.sendShippingConfirmation` to the `customer`."

Once you provide this kind of specific, application-level detail structured around the "Concept Design" principles, I can help you transform it into a more formal API specification format (like an OpenAPI/Swagger definition).
