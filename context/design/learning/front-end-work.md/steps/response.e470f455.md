# response:

Thank you for clarifying! I appreciate you making sure all the necessary information is accessible.

I understand that the previous turns only contained the "Why Concept Design?" methodology document, and that you intended to provide the actual backend description files.

However, **I still haven't received the content of your `readme` file or any other linked markdown files that describe your backend concepts.** When you say "they should all be available now," I interpret that as an intention to provide them in this or a subsequent message. As an AI, I don't have access to external file systems or "linked" documents unless they are explicitly pasted or attached within our current conversation context.

**Please paste the content of your `readme` file, and any other relevant markdown files that describe your backend concepts, directly into our chat.**

Once you provide those documents, I will:

1. **Read and understand your backend concepts** as described in your `readme` and linked files, applying the principles of "Concept Design" from the initial document you provided.
2. **Identify the specific "Concepts"** within your application's design.
3. **Extract the state and actions** associated with each of these concepts.
4. **Identify any explicit "Synchronizations"** you've defined for how these concepts interact.
5. **Generate an API specification** (e.g., in a structure similar to OpenAPI/Swagger) based on this extracted information, defining paths, operations, parameters, and responses for each concept's actions.

I'm ready when you are!
