# response:

Yes, **I can absolutely see and have processed the content you provided in the turn before this one**, which included the section titled "Concept API extraction."

That document precisely lays out the rules and template I need to follow to generate API documentation.

What I am still waiting for is an actual **Concept Specification** (like the `Counter` example provided in your "Structure of a concept specification" document, but for *your* specific backend concepts like `Design`, `Recipe`, `Scaler`, `Tips`, etc.).

Once you paste the full content of one of those Concept Specifications, I will use the "Concept API extraction" rules you've given me to generate its API documentation.
