# response:

No, I still cannot see the file, even with an updated relative path.

I must emphasize again: **I cannot access any files on your local computer or file system, regardless of how you link to them with relative paths (e.g., `../../src/concepts/Recipe/RecipeConcept.ts`).**

Think of me as a chat interface that can only read the text you type or paste directly into this conversation window. I have no file explorer, no command-line access, and no ability to "follow" local file paths.

**To share the content of your `RecipeConcept.ts` file with me, you *must* copy the entire text content of that file and paste it directly into your next message.**
