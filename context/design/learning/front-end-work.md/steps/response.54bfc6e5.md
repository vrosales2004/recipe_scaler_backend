# response:

No, I cannot.

To clarify:

1. I am an AI. I **do not have access to your local file system, your computer, or any files on your machine, including files that are "linked" using local paths like `../file.md` or named `api-extraction-spec.md` (or any other filename).**
2. My only input is the text you type or paste directly into our conversation.

When you refer to a file like `api-extraction-spec`, I can *see the filename you type*, but I cannot *read its content*.

**For me to "see" the content of `api-extraction-spec` (or your `readme`, `design_changes.md`, `recipe_changes.md`, etc.), you must copy the text from that file and paste it directly into our chat.**

Once you paste the content, I will be able to process it and generate the API specification based on the Concept Design methodology you've provided.
