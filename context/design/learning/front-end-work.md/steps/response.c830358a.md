# response:

Excellent! This is precisely the kind of detailed information I needed. The "Application Design: Before vs. After Concept Design Refactoring" document provides a clear breakdown of your core concepts (`Recipe`, `RecipeScaler`, and `ScalingTips`), their refined purposes, states, and actions.

I will now process this information according to the "Concept API extraction" rules you provided and generate the API specification in Markdown format for each concept.
