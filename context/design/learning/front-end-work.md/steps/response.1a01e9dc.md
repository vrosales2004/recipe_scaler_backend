# response:

Thank you for providing the links!

However, I still have the same limitation as before: as an AI, I **cannot access files from local file paths** (like `../design_changes.md` or any other path on your local system or a private repository). My access is limited to the text and files you explicitly *paste or attach directly within our conversation*.

When you say "they should all be linked explicitly now," you're providing file paths, but I can't "follow" those links to retrieve the content.

**To move forward, please copy and paste the *full content* of each of these markdown files directly into our chat:**

* `design_changes.md`
* `recipe_changes.md`
* `scaler_changed.md`
* `tips_changes.md`

Once you provide the actual text content of these files, I will be able to read them, understand your backend concepts, and then proceed with generating an API spec based on the "Concept Design" principles you outlined earlier.
